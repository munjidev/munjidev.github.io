<br/>

Hi! I'm Juan Muniain, a Software Engineer and Game Developer from Mexico City. "munji" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my projects under, which is usually accompanied by the picture in the bottom left.
<br/>
<br/>
I am primarily skilled in 3D animation, rigging, modeling and texturing, with Blender as my daily driver for creating assets, as well as programming/implementation in Unreal and Godot. I'm also knowledgeable about workflows involving Autodesk and Adobe software.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I dedicate most of my time towards game development and animation, I enjoy playing guitar and cooking nice meals often, as well as tend to my cat, Oreo. You can catch a glimpse of my stuff on Bluesky.
